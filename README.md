# Hi there, I'm Alex 

I'm a junior at the University of Florida majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. My academic journey and practical experiences have fueled my passion for backend and full-stack development.

## About Me
For the past two summers, I've completed internships where I worked on backend services and microservices, honing my skills in building scalable and efficient systems. Beyond internships, I've also contributed to full-stack applications, both through school clubs and personal projects, which has expanded my experience in bringing ideas to life from front to back.
